Disable Any Class

What this mod does:
- Prevents disabled classes from being selected by unit promitions, mission rewards, the resistance headquarters or the black market.

What this mod does NOT do:
- Remove knowledge of disabled classes from the game engine.
- Prevent the user from training disabled classes at the GTS.
- Remove perks for disabled classes from the GTS.

Disabled classes can be selected at any time from an in-game mod configuration menu using this mod and will apply to any campaigns played while the mod is active.

Disable Any Class currently uses [WotC] Mod Config Menu to provide the in-game UI for selecting disabled classes.

Known Bugs:
It's entirely possible that I've missed some condition under which soldier classes are automatically chosen. If you receive a disabled character class during your campaign, please let me know how that happened!
