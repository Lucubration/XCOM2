Disable Any Class

What this mod does:
- Prevents disabled classes from being selected by unit promitions, mission rewards, the resistance headquarters or the black market.

What this mod does NOT do:
- Remove knowledge of disabled classes from the game engine.
- Prevent the user from training disabled classes at the GTS.
- Remove perks for disabled classes from the GTS.

Disabled classes can be selected at any time from an in-game mod configuration menu using this mod and will apply to any campaigns played while the mod is active.

Disable Any Class currently uses the Mod Options Menu RFC version to provide the in-game UI for selecting disabled classes; however, I have long-term plans to integrate the Mod Configuration Manager API as the UI provider once it is publicly released.

Known Bugs:
It's entirely possible that I've missed some condition under which soldier classes are automatically chosen. If you receive a disabled character class during your campaign, please let me know how that happened!
