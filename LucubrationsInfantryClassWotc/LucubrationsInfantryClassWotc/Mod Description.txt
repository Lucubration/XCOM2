Adds an Infantry class to the game with many new abilities.

Initial Release (9/4/2017):

The Infantry class is a basic rifleman class styled after its namesake from the original Long War mod. Infantry use a rifle as their primary weapon and a pistol as their secondary weapon.

The Infantry class has two perk trees: the "Regular" Infantry and the "Irregular" Infantry. The Regular is intended to be a tough customer, able to take some hits and act as a roadblock to the enemy advance if necessary. The Irregular is intended to put pressure on the enemy, having means to exploit positions of advantage and some way of escaping the tight spots they can put themselves in.
