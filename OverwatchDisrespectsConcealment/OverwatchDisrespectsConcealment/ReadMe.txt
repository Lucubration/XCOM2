A.K.A. the Anti-Jake Solomon Maneuver


Removes the condition against firing from concealment for all reaction fire abilities in the game.

Initial Release: 3/11/2016

This mechanic was very annoying to me, so I changed it.

Compatibility: 
There shouldn't be any conflicts with other mods. I'm not directly modifying the default templates or anything, just ducking in and editing them after they've been created.

For a slightly different take on Overwatch rules that still allows reaction fire abilities to fire from concealment but also applies the standard reaction fire aim penalty, check out Overwatch Ignores Concealment instead:
