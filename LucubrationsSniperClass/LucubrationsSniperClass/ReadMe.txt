Hey, folks! I'm back again with another soldier class mod. Today I have the pleasure of introducing the Sniper.

The Sniper is a highly-trained specialist unit, capable of precision marksmanship at incredible range and special tactics designed to give the Sniper an edge on the battlefield.

In the school of Marksmanship, Snipers are trained to make every shot count. An expert Marksman gets the shot in the right place, at the right time, every time.

The Operator is highly-trained in individual battlefield tactics. An expert Operator can ambush their unsuspecting foes from the best available positions, striking with sudden fury and clearing the field for their next targets.

Weapons
Primary Weapons: Sniper Rifle
Secondary Weapons: Pistol

Configuration:
After starting the game with this mod loaded, you can find customizable .ini values in the file "Documents\my games\XCOM2\XComGame\Config\XComLucubrationsSniperClass.ini".
Edits to values in this file will not be overwritten when I push a new version of the mod unless the value range changes and I need to validate the values you have configured, or the value becomes obsolete and no longer has any effect in gameplay.

Known bugs:
None, yet.

Compatibility:
I don't know of any mod conflicts.
