Adjusts the Grenader skill Demolition to use a small, free-targeting sphere for envrionmental destruction.

Version 1.2: 3/20/2016

Changed the collision detection of the targeting cursor to not snap to the center of the blocking tile.

Cooldown was accidentally left at 0 turns for testing. I've restored this to its original 4 turns.

If you disagree with the choices I made for radius and cooldown, I encourage you to change them.

Version 1.1: 3/20/2016

Updated to do template modification instead of replacement for the Demolition ability (for possible mod compatibility).

Initial Release: 3/20/2016

The Grenadier ability Demolition has often felt to me like an unreliable substitute for the Enemy Within ability Collateral Damage.

This mod changes the mechanics of Demolition to make it reliably apply environmental damage to objects in a small, free-targeting sphere.
